Locale-CLDR

Please note that this code requires Perl 5.10.1 and above in the main. There are some parts that require
Perl 5.18 and if you are using Unicode in Perl you really should be using Perl 5.18 or later

The general overview of the project is to convert the XML of the CLDR into a large number of small Perl
modules that can be loaded from the main Local::CLDR when needed to do what ever localisation is required.

Note that the API is not yet fixed. I'll try and keep things that have tests stable but any thing else 
is at your own risk.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

Locale Data
This is a locale data package, you will need the Locale::CLDR package to get it to work, which if you are using the 
CPAN client should have been installed for you.
WARNING
This package has insufficient tests. If you feel like helping get hold of the Locale::CLDR::Locales::En package from CPAN
or use the git repository at https://github.com/ThePilgrim/perlcldr and use the tests from that to create a propper test 
suite for this language pack. Please send me a copy of the tests, either by a git pull request, which will get your name into
the git history or by emailing me using my email address on CPAN.
